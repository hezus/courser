# Courser

We are going to create a Student course app today with React on a Rails backend.

Our system needs to handle the following:

1. Display a list of resources
2. Provide a form for creating new resources
3. Provide a form for editing resources
4. Provide the ability to delete resources
5. Play nice with a restful API
6. Be extensible

We want to be able to create Courses
We want to be able to create Students
We want to assign students to the courses

---------------------
We will be using the [react-starter provided by Rory](https://github.com/Codaisseur/react-starter)

I have already created a simple rails backend for you to be downloaded at: location

At the end of this exercise you should:
> Learn about the react router
> Create forms for various resources
> Create a structure in your application

#Stores
To add some structure to our application we will use Stores. A store will be responsible for managing the resources
